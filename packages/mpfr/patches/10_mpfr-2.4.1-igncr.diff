Recent versions of autoconf are incompatible with Cygwin bash igncr, causing
mpfr's configure to fail when igncr is used.  This patch works around the
problem to allow configure to succeed.  This issue is currently being worked
on upstream by the autoconf maintainers, but it may be quite a while before
the fix propagates into an MPFR release.
